Some fun with RecyclerView and DataBinding, Shared Element Activity Transitions, Service and Broadcasts.<br>
<br><br>
App contains two activities.<br>
For first activity we load data from LCBO api and fill in RecyclerView with DataBinding.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We can remove item from RV by swype.<br>
For second activity we display product detailed description.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we navigate between activities - product image view is shared element between two activities.<br>
<br>
For both activities realized service that send broadcast intent with time string and random img (url the same, so image different between app launches).<br>
<br>
Not solved problem with back navigation, when image can be drawed over toolbar in animation.<br>
